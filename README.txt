iCub Grasp Dataset

== Introduction ==

This dataset contains grasping data for nine-everyday objects 
(and a base-line "no object") collected using the iCub humanoid platform. 
The objects are: plastic bottle (full), plastic bottle (half-full), 
plastic bottle (empty), soda can (half-full), soda can (empty), 
teddy bear, monkey soft-toy, a bottle of lotion and a hardcover book. 

** There is an additional "full-coke" object but we had problems during
data collection and this data should not be considered reliable.

For details about how this dataset was collected, please refer to the 
paper:

One should be available on my website soon: http://www.haroldsoh.com

== MATLAB Script ==
There is a MATLAB script to load the data: loadGraspData.m

This will produce two main structures: 

raw_data{object_id, trial}: The raw data is organised as described in the 
next section.

processed_data{object_id, trial}: Each row is a vector of features, i.e.,
9 encoder features and 10 tactile features (the mean and std for each 
of the 5 finger).

== Dataset Details and File Format ==

All files are contained within the iCubGraspDataset folder. 
Each of the 10 object classes was grasped 20 times (a trial).
 Each trial is stored in a separate file labelled in order from 1 to 20. 
For example, blue_bear_8.txt contains the tactile and encoder values for 
the iCub fingers for the blue teddy bear object on the 8th grasping trial. 

The file itself is formatted. The first line (-10000) can be safely 
ignored. Each time slice is represented by 7 lines. For example:

Line Number and Explanation:
1: the encoder values for each of the joints in the iCub hand (joints 7-15)
2: max(255 - tactile reading) for each of the five fingers 
3: the tactile reading for each of the twelve sensors for the thumb
4: the tactile reading for each of the twelve sensors for the index finger
5: the tactile reading for each of the twelve sensors for the middle finger
6: the tactile reading for each of the twelve sensors for the ring finger
7: the tactile reading for each of the twelve sensors for the little finger
